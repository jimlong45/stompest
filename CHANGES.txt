1.0.4
    Bug fix thanks to [Njal Karevoll](https://github.com/nkvoll).  No longer relies on newline after the null-byte frame separator.  Library is now compatible with RabbitMQ stomp adapter.
1.1.1
    Thanks to [nikipore](https://github.com/nikipore) for adding support for binary messages.
1.1.2
    Fixed issue with stomper adding a space in ACK message-id header. ActiveMQ 5.6.0 no longer tolerates this.
2.0a1
    Complete redesign: feature-complete implementation of STOMP 1.0 and 1.1 (except heartbeating). Broker failover. Decoupled from [stomper](http://code.google.com/p/stomper/).
