class StompConfig(object):
    """This is a container for those configuration options which are common to both clients (sync and async) and are needed to establish a STOMP connection. All parameters are available as attributes with the same name of this object.

    :param uri: A failover URI as it is accepted by :class:`~.StompFailoverUri`.
    :param login: The login for the STOMP brokers.
    :param passcode: The passcode for the STOMP brokers.
    :param version: A valid STOMP protocol version, or :obj:`None` (equivalent to the :attr:`DEFAULT_VERSION` attribute of the :class:`~.StompSpec` class).
    :param check: Decides whether the :class:`~.StompSession` object which is used to represent the STOMP sesion should be strict about the session's state: (e.g., whether to allow calling the session's :meth:`~.StompSession.send` when disconnected).

    .. note :: Login and passcode have to be the same for all brokers because they are not part of the failover URI scheme.

    .. seealso :: The :class:`~.StompFailoverTransport` class which tells you which broker to use and how long you should wait to connect to it, the :class:`~.StompFailoverUri` which parses failover transport URIs.
